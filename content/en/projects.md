# CREATE
Innovative operations and Climate and weatheR modEls to improve Atmosphere resiliencE (CREATE) project will study the vulnerability of the ATM system concerning weather phenomena to enhance ATM procedures so that vulnerability can be reduced.
Studying the impact of aviation on the environment, both short and long term (climate), to propose ATM operational changes able to reduce such impact.
Studying possible new meteo tools and methodologies to integrate their use in ATMs.
Validating proposed ATM operational changes to reduce ATM environmental impact and improve ATM resilience concerning the weather.
Grant Agreement number 890898 - CREATE - H2020-SESAR-2019-2.
2020 -- 2023.

# AEROMAT
Use of innovative technologies, materials, and models in the aeronautical field, coordinated by SEtna Hitech S.C.P.A.' and carried out in collaboration with other Italian excellences. The project's primary objective is to improve the quality of the forecasts concerning the airspace and the ground deposits of volcanic ash and dust, thanks to a modeling system that will integrate data from volcanological observatories with meteorological data predicted by models high resolution.
2018 -- 2022.

# CMMMA
Center for Marine and Atmospheric Monitoring and Modelling, meteo@uniparthenope.
The CMMMA, continuing the aims of the previous CCMMMA project, offers weather, marine, and air quality forecasting services to ordinary people, local government, research institutes, private companies, environmental and health assessment companies, nautical control authorities yachting, sports partnerships, and others.
